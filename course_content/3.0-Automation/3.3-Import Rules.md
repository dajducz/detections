# 3.3 :: Import Rules

You've done the hard part of automating, now I will leave you with an easy task. In the `rules/testing/section 3.3` folder there are some sigma rules that we'll see in action later. Move those rules to your production folder.

From here we can force the script associated with our cronjob to run and push the rules to Splunk. Since our script should automatically hit the refresh endpoint, we can navigate to `Settings -> Searches, Reports, and Alerts`. Select our Sigma app and change the `Owner` to `All`. We've got searches in here now and they have a scheduled time. Feel free to run these searches manually, but they will run automatically and write events to the `notable_events` index. If you have not done so already, create this index by going to `Settings -> Indexes` selecting `New Index` and then naming it `notable_events` and hitting save.

When these searches run they will write to the `notable_events` index but based on how we're using the `| collect` command from Splunk, the `_time` field will be when the event was originally executed on the test host in my lab. Keep this in mind as you're looking through this index. If you do not see any events after the searches have successfully ran, increase the search window to `All Time`.
