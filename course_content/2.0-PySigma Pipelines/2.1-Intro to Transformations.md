# 2.1 :: Intro to Transformations

The primary purpose of a logsource pipeline is, as stated previously, to transform publicly agreed upon rules into however it is that you decided (or some vendor decided) to format the logs in your environment. This is done through **transformations**.

In the following example, I demonstrate a fundamental transformation and one that you will use in every log source pipeline that you develop. Let me first break down this transformation so that you can better understand how the other transformations work and eventually build your own.

```yaml
transformations:
    - id: index_condition
      type: add_condition
      conditions:
        index: winevent
      rule_conditions:
      - type: logsource
        product: windows
```

Line-by-line:

- `transformations:`: This tells your PySigma interpreter that you are starting the section of the pipeline that will contain the transformations. Everything below this line that is a transformation must be indented one tab (2 spaces? 4 spaces? 5 spaces?!?? You decide.)
- `- id: index_condition`: This is just the name of the transformation. Do yourself a favor and make these descriptive so when you are reviewing this pipeline with your peers you can easily find the transformation you’d like to discuss.   
- `type: add_condition`: The `type` keyword here informs the interpreter that you are about to define the “type” of transformation that is going to happen. In this case we are using the `add_condition` transformation that says, when some defined rule condition is met, this `key:value` pair is added to the finalized query. In our case it is saying "If the log source of the Sigma rule being passed to this pipeline has the `product: windows` `key:value` pair, then inject into the query the `key:value` pair of `index:winevent`". 

>	*Remember here that log source pipelines and backends are independent structures - this pipeline doesn’t know that you want SPL as your final product. Only the Splunk Backend will know that you want `index: winevent` to transform to `index=winevent` to match proper SPL syntax.*

- `rule_condtions:`: Here we are asking the interpreter to recognize that the following stanza is the conditions in which this transformation rule will apply. There are three options: 
	1. `logsource` (most common)
	2. `contains_detection_item`
	3. `processing_item_applied`
- `- type: logsource`: Similar to the type statement above, we are now defining the "type" of `rule_condition` that is being applied. In our case we are using a `logsource` type which tells the interpreter that the next line should be a reference to the `logsource` stanza in the Sigma rule.
- `product: windows`: Here we are telling the interpreter the literal `key:value` pair we are looking for. This pipeline will specifically apply to Sigma rules focused on the Windows product. We may include up to all three log source fields `product`, `service`, `application` to make the transformation more specific if needed for the transformation. We will do this later.

The `add_condition` transformation type is one that will be used in every log source pipeline that you create. There is one particular transformation object that is going to be used significantly more in any pipeline you build: `field_name_mapping`. Let me start with an example:

```yaml
    - id: registry_add_fieldmapping
      type: field_name_mapping
      mapping:
        Image: RegStringValue
      rule_conditions:
        - type: logsource
          product: windows
          category: registry_set
```

The `field_name_mapping` transformation type will tell the interpreter that when some specific rule condition is met, to look for a field that matches the `key` in the `key:value` pair under `mapping:` with the `value` when passing the logic to your backend for conversion. This may sound complicated, but it is a fundamental function of pipeline transformations. This is the exact logic that allows the Sigma community to use their agreed upon field name conventions even if they do not match the field names that are used in your logs. Consider the following rule and copy/paste the Sigma rule and Pipeline into the online converter tool, sigconverter.io:

```yaml
title: Add Port Monitor Persistence in Registry
id: 944e8941-f6f6-4ee8-ac05-1c224e923c0e
status: experimental
description: |
  Adversaries may use port monitors to run an attacker supplied DLL during system boot for persistence or privilege escalation.
  A port monitor can be set through the AddMonitor API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup.

        condition: selection and not 1 of filter_*
falsepositives:
        - Unknown

```

In the context of the logs that we are building this pipeline for, our logs use the field name `RegStringValue` to mean the same thing that the Sysmon logs call `Image`. Because of this, the pipeline will need to transform and `map` the value of `Image:` to `RegStringValue:`. This rule will then convert to the following SPL:

```  
TargetObject="HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Print\\Monitors\\*" Details="*.dll" NOT ((RegStringValue="C:\\Windows\\System32\\spoolsv.exe" TargetObject="*\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Print\\Monitors\\CutePDF Writer Monitor v4.0\\Driver*" Details="cpwmon64_v40.dll" User IN ("*AUTHORI*", "*AUTORI*")) OR TargetObject="*Control\\Print\\Monitors\\MONVNC\\Driver*" OR (TargetObject="*Control\\Print\\Environments\\*" TargetObject="*\\Drivers\\*" TargetObject="*\\VNC Printer*"))
```

And just like that, this rule will now properly run against the logs!

### Check for Understanding

Imagine you, a strapping young cyber security consultant, are brought to a new client’s office and they are asking you to help build a new detection engineering infrastructure. They have given you access to their SIEM and you’d like to demonstrate some immediate value by implementing a rule you saw in a blog over the weekend:

```yaml
title: Telegram API Access
id: b494b165-6634-483d-8c47-2026a6c52372

```

But there is one problem. The proxy logs that they have given you do not have the fieldnames used in this sigma rule and you would like them to automatically convert. You know that their proxy logs are stored in an index named `netskope_logs`. The fields used in that index are such that `cs-host` maps to `hostname` and `c-useragent` maps to `useragent`.

Build a basic pipeline that will transform the SPL generated from this sigma rule such that it will be valid for the logs your client has provided. Use `sigconverter.io` to validate your work.
