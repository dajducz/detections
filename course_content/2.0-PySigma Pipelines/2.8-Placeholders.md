# 2.8 :: Placeholders

Placeholder are one of the concepts in Sigma that can really shine when used in an enterprise environment. Placeholders can take an item in a rule and expand it to be some other much more complicated expression.

Take the following rule:

```yaml
title: RDP Originating From Domain Controller
id: fda34293-718e-4b36-b018-38caab0d1209

While reading this you may wonder "what does `Computer|expand: '%domain_controller_hostnames%'` do?" Well, without a corresponding transformation in your pipeline, it will do nothing more than leave you a nice error message. We have a few placeholder transformation types to handle this.

1. Query expressions: Replace the placeholder with a query expression that will be used in your SIEM in place of that value.
2. Value lists: Replace the placeholder with a list of values defined in the pipeline.
3. Wildcards: Replace the placeholder with a wildcard (useful for unhandled placeholders).

Generally you want to explicitly call out every placeholder you intend to use in your pipeline and define a transformation of either type 1 or type 2. In the rule above you would want a comprehensive list of your domain controller hostnames somewhere that can be expanded during rule conversion. Let's make one:

```yaml
name: value_placeholder_pipeline
vars:
    domain_controller_hostnames:
        - 'DC01'
        - 'DC02'
        - 'DC03'
transformations:
    - type: value_placeholders
      include:
            - 'domain_controller_hostnames'
```

Here we are using a value list placeholder transformation and defining our list of domain controllers right in the `vars:` field of a pipeline file. This would transform into the following SPL query:

`Initiated="True" DestinationPort=3389 Computer IN ("DC01", "DC02", "DC03") NOT Image="Microsoft.Tri.Sensor.exe"`

This is useful for small lists that don't change much, but it is not very scalable. That is where query expression transformations are really handy. 

```yaml
name: query_expression_pipeline
transformations:
    - id: domain_controller_hostnames_placeholder
      type: query_expression_placeholders
      include:
          - 'domain_controller_hostnames'
      expression: "[|inputlookup domain_controllers.csv | rename hosts as ComputerName | fields ComputerName]"
```

This will convert to:
`Initiated="True" DestinationPort=3389 [|inputlookup domain_controllers.csv | rename hosts as ComputerName | fields ComputerName] NOT Image="Microsoft.Tri.Sensor.exe"`

Look at that! Now we can use our dynamically updated lookup list on our Splunk search head and drop it directly into a query that will pull the list at search time.
