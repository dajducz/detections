# 2.2 :: Condition Statements

Transformations are pretty coolâ€”if we wanted to, we could just write generic transformations that applied to every detection. But we don't want to. Instead we want to apply a transformation under a specific circumstance in which the transformation logic makes sense. For example we only want to assign the `index=win_event` stanza when we are processing a Windows detection, right?

Condition statements allow us to define the criteria in which a transformation is allowed to take place.

There are three types of conditions:

1. **Rule conditions** are evaluated to the whole rule. They are defined in the `rule_conditions` attribute of a ProcessingItem. These can be applied in the rule pre-processing stage and the query post-processing stage.
2. **Detection item conditions** are evaluated for each detection item. They are defined in the detection_item_conditions attribute of a ProcessingPipeline. These can only be applied in the rule pre-processing stage.
3. **Field name conditions** are evaluated for field names that can be located in detection items or in the field name list of a Sigma rule. They are defined in the `field_name_conditions` attribute of `detection_item_conditions` attribute of a ProcessingPipeline. These can only be applied in the rule pre-processing stage.

[PySigma Processing Pipelines Documentation](https://sigmahq-pysigma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Processing_Pipelines.html)

Each of these condition types can be broken down into additional subtypes. Additionally, these conditions can be stacked and you can use many at a time. The documentation for PySigma can be a little opaque, so we'll break this down together and work with some examples.

### Rule Conditions

A rule condition is applied to a whole rule and likely the most common condition item that you will see. Here is an example:

```yaml
    - id: cs_file_event_fieldmapping
      type: field_name_mapping
      mapping:
          Image: ContextImageFileName
      rule_conditions:
          - type: logsource
            product: windows
            category: file_event
```

In this case we are using the `rule_conditions:` stanza and the `logsource` type. You've seen this before! This transformation will look for the logsource in the Sigma rule that matches:

```yaml
logsource:
    product: windows
    category: file_event
```

When that match is `True` then the mapping transformation will apply. An important note about the `logsource` transformation: if you do not explicitly define a logsource field, a wildcard is applied. This means that the following logsource would also be `True`:

```yaml
logsource:
    product: windows
    category: file_event
    service: explorer
```
The rule_conditions condition type has three subtypes:

1. `logsource`: used to define the specific logsource to apply the transformation to.
2. `contains_detection_item`: used when you're looking for a specific detection item in the `detection:` stanza of the Sigma rule.
3. `processing_item_applied`: used to ensure that a processing item has been applied to a rule. This is very useful in post-processing if you want to define a specific template to use after specific transformations have taken place.

These last two are pretty rare so I won't dwell on them.

### Detection Item Conditions

Detection item conditions can only be applied in the pre-processing stage. That is to say, once the processing of transformations has been done we can no longer use this condition type. That is okay because this is an underused condition type anyway. This condition type is only concerned with the `detections:` stanza of the Sigma rule and nothing else.

There are two subtypes:

1. `match_string`: matches any string value in the detection items using a regular expression.
2. `processing_item_applied`: Just like the rule_condition type, this checks to see if a processing item has been applied. Because this does not work in post-processing, this can only identify processing items that happen before this one.

### Field Name Conditions

Field name conditions evaluate the field names either in the `detection:` stanza or in the `fields:` stanza. These cannot be used in post processing.

There are three subtypes:

1. `include_fields`: Match on a field name. Regex can be used here by using the `type` parameter but the default is to just use a literal plain string match.
2. `exclude_fields`: The opposite of include_fields and will match to `True` if the field being asked about is not present
3. `processing_item_applied`: yes, this one again. Resolves to `True` if a processing item has been previously applied.

Here is an example of where I've used a field_name_condition before:

```yaml
## Drop all rules with the EventID field to handle all other rules in the /builtin folder
    - id: cs_drop_eventid
      type: detection_item_failure
      message: CrowdStrike logs do not support the field EventID at this time.
      field_name_conditions:
          - type: include_fields
            fields:
                - EventID
      rule_conditions:
          - type: logsource
            product: windows
```


In this example we know that CrowdStrike logs do not contain the `EventID` field and if we pass a Sigma rule that utilizes the `EventID` field as a primary detection premise. We should just drop an error to our logs and move on. This allows us to ignore the transformation of a rule that we just know would never work anyway.

### Check for Understanding

Before moving on, I want to present some scenarios for you and have you identify which type of condition statement would be the best choice. If you're feeling confident, feel free to write the whole transformation.
1. Your Sigma rule should only apply to logs generated by a Linux host
2. If a detection item starts with an escape character, you know your SIEM will not be able to be able to process the rule and it needs to be dropped.
3. Your favorite word is `hostname` and you want to make sure that every rule that you process includes the field name `hostname`.
