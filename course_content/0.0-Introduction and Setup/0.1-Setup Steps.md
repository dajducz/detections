# 0.1 :: Setup Steps

- Install Docker
	- For the most up-to-date steps, [follow the official Docker setup guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
	- For a full and comprehensive understanding of Docker, consider pausing here and taking the [Container Essentials course.](https://taggartinstitute.org/p/container-essentials)
- Configure Docker:
	- `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
	- `newgrp docker`
	- `docker container run hello-world`
- Clone this repo:
	- `git clone https://github.com/The-Taggart-Institute/detection-with-sigma`
- Build the Splunk Docker image
	- `docker pull splunk/splunk:latest`
- Write the following data into a file named `compose.yml` Keep this file outside of the `detection-with-sigma` folder as it will contain plaintext passwords that we do not want to risk being in our public GitHub repo. In case you ignore this instruction, I have added compose.yml to the git ignore file.

```yaml
services:
    sigma-splunk:
        image: splunk/splunk:latest
        container_name: sigma-splunk
        environment:
            SPLUNK_START_ARGS: --accept-license
            SPLUNK_PASSWORD: ChangeMe!
        ports:
            - 8000:8000
            - 8089:8089
            - 9997:9997
        volumes:
            - ~/detection-with-sigma/app/sigma/:/opt/splunk/etc/apps/sigma
            - ~/detection-with-sigma/app/sigma-index:/opt/splunk/var
```

- run `docker compose up -d`
- Open Visual Studio Code by running the command `code .` in the `/course_content` folder

Now we are ready to open up Splunk and confirm everything looks as we expect it to. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://<IP address of your Docker host>:8000` and log in with the username `admin` and the password you created in your docker compose file. Confirm that the Sigma app is listed in your apps folder on the Splunk UI.
