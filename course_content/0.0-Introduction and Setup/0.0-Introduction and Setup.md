# 0.0 :: Introduction and Setup

During this course we will discuss how to implement and design a Sigma backend that will allow you to convert rules and automatically implement them in your environment. By automating this process you can significantly improve the speed at which your detection engineering program can generate and implement rules written by your team or by the greater Sigma community. By the end of this course you should understand how Sigma rules are converted using PySigma, Pipelines, and Backends, be able to build or customize a pipeline for your environment, and understand how to read and write your own Sigma rules.

To be successful in this course, you will need access to a virtual machine or a bare metal computer that at minimum can run a Docker container hosting a Splunk instance and an instance of Visual Studio Code with the features for remote SSH installed. We will also be using Git and GitHub for this course and it is recommended that you take the time now to set up your GitHub account and configure your hardware. The instructions provided below can be followed exactly and understanding Docker and Docker Compose files is not necessary and subsequently out of scope for this course.

As a final note before you get started, this course will have an associated GitHub. Everything you need for this course will be here.
